# Chess analyse (freelance)

The point was to analyse more than 67000 games and extract some highlight and insights.  The client wanted to use these findings to supplement a book he was writing about his grandfather, who was an excellent chess player. This notebook represents my work on all its games from the chess.com site.
If you want to check the book and , why not , improve your chess game , it's available on amazon : https://www.amazon.fr/50-Surprising-Chess-Puzzles-1200-1400/dp/B0BV1P4X4Z
